Finished overall UI look for main functionality of tracking workouts. Used React Native Calendar library to present a view after users login. Then I added a section for workouts and settings. I've established the ability to add workout titles, and or exercises using convex database but I'm trying to figure out a way to render the exercises under each workout. Below is my attached progress using utlizing Agenda to keep track of my progress/goals.

I had a delay in production due to me focusing on school. I ended up revamping the color scheme to a black and white theme. I deployed the application to app store connect with the basic functions of the app working.
I.e ( currently ): 
User can create and sign in using Clerk API into the application. Signing Up is verified through email verification.
User then can create workouts with the exercise variables - Name, amount of sets, reps, and weight. User then can delete, or log workout onto calendar to keep track of progress. 
Settings page lets user sign out. 

Future development will be:
- making UI better
- Able to edit workouts
- Settings will be replaced with profile of a user (height, weight, etc.)
- A trend page will be added to compare statistics for the user such as their consistency to go workout.
- Then finally/maybe integrate  an AI chatbot to help users with any type of fitness related prompts.
