Finished overall UI look for main functionality of tracking workouts. Used React Native Calendar library to present a view after users login. Then I added a section for workouts and settings. I've established the ability to add workout titles, and or exercises using convex database but I'm trying to figure out a way to render the exercises under each workout. Below is my attached progress using utlizing Agenda to keep track of my progress/goals.
